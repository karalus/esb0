# ESB Zero - A minimal viable service gateway

Features:
- Supports the well known VETRO pattern
- Executes service flows defined in XML which can be crafted in an XML editor or could be generated by a service repository
- Supports SOAP, JSON/REST and **generic** conversion between each (just include a XSD and everything is done for you, no need to build the correct XML manually)
- HTTP authentication (based on JEE i.e. JAAS)
- basic support for [CORS](https://enable-cors.org)
- Supports efficient XML Pipelines based on XQJ (XQuery API for Java)
- Service flows can make use of XPath 2.0, XQuery 3.1 and XSLT 3.0 interchangeably within one streaming pipeline
- For accessing data inside of JSON we use [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) (Message transformation with JSON data can be done with XSLT or XQuery)
- Java code can be invoked dynamically if necessary e.g. for special transformations
- Supports HTTP(S), JMS, JDBC, SMTP, Files and [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
- Can use new JDK HTTP Client thus facilitate asynchronous HTTP and HTTP/2 outbound
- Can map between synchronous and asynchronous messages exchange patterns
- Supports GZIP and [Fast Infoset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Infoset) encoding/decoding and MTOM/XOP
- Uses resource- and thread pools for effective resource utilization, thus supporting QoS per service.
- Includes a HTTP load balancer component with customizable health check for outbound HTTP traffic
- New service flows and thread pools can be configured at runtime without service outage
- Is performant like a network component. Can act at the speed of a reverse proxy (only few millis penalty) even when processing XML.
- Outperforms most other Service Gateways when XML processing is needed.
- Small memory requirements. Even with 32MB heap you can run service flows. 
- Simple REST admin services to deploy and control service flows
- JMX support, i.e. MBeans for remote monitoring & management
- JMS Providers and JDBC DataSources can be created and updated on the fly
- Asynchronous JMS send is supported with JMS 2.0 capable providers
- Offers vendor independent JMS outbound loadbalancing supporting HA and active/active

### Fitness for production ###

ESB0 is currently running at one of our customers site in production since December 2018 processing millions of business transactions a day. XML messages are up to 20Mb of size. No unplanned outages and overall only a few seconds of major GC time spent per month (the former commercial ESB product had a 16s major GC every 5min and needed to be restarted every night).

Current stable version is 1.11.0.

### Design goals ###

Most ESB products are very heavy suites which is counterproductive for their main purpose - to act as a fast and simple service gateway to control and monitor service usage within your enterprise.

ESB Zero is designed to be very small and thus manageable. The zipped (7zip) sources are currently about 128k of size!

The minimal set of features is supported based on the VETRO pattern. All basic EAI components that are needed are built-in with the exemption of stateful components (e.g. [resequencer](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/Resequencer.html)). As the ESB Zero does not maintain state on its own, it can be easily scaled up and runs very stable.

Having no built-in state does not necessarily mean that you need more tools or products. You can build many patterns with ESB Zero and a MOM and/or DB. For instance the mentioned resequencer can be realized with two ESB Zero service flows and a DB table in the middle (First flow puts messages into the table along with sequence nr and timestamp and the second flow polls the table for messages arrived before a given period of time in the correct order and forwards the messages to the next endpoint).
This general concept puts the burden of persistent state (not losing or corrupting it) on the MOM/DB.

ESB Zero is not meant to be used for complex EAI scenarios (Orchestration, COTS Components, ETL, complex logic, ...). For this end better use another tool.

### FAQ ###

*Why not using Apache Camel?*

Apache Camel is a great project, but with offering > 200 Components and all known EAI patterns it is already too huge for the above mentioned purpose.

*Why not using Apache Karaf for deploying?*

OSGi is a great idea when managing different versions of JARs but unnecessarily complex for not code based artifacts.

*Why not using Apache CXF?*

For a generic gateway which is not really processing the data content this is not needed.

*How to achieve good performance and having small memory footprint when processing XML?*

XML pipelining is an efficient means because it does not require to have a full DOM in memory but can rather do streaming in certain scenarios. Refer to e.g. https://www.progress.com/tutorials/xquery/api-for-java-xqj

Currently ESB Zero uses well proven [Saxon](http://saxon.sourceforge.net/) but basically could be run with any [XQJ](http://xqj.net/) compliant product.

*Will this technology be superseded by Spring Boot plus Camel (new JBoss Fusion concept) running inside of a Docker container?*

Using Camel with Spring Boot will run you a few EAI services well, but is not suitable for a scenario where >100 services need to be mediated while only needing endpoint virtualization and validation.
Besides, the memory footprint of ESB Zero running webservices inside docker is even less than Spring Boot plus Camel!

*Will this technology be superseded by Istio?*

Yes, when all of the services in your enterprise are micro services talking natively REST/JSON! No monoliths, no legacy, no 3rd party stuff. I.e. that means a no for the mid-term future for most of us. While I'm a big fan of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) I don't expect that everything will be ÂµServices soon.
Even in a Kubernetes environment where endpoint virtualization and load balancing is done by K8s Controller, ESB Zero can be used (also as a sidecar) to provide for message transformation/validation (e.g JSON/XML) and protocol conversion (e.g. HTTP/JMS).

### How to build ###

You need to have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed.

ESB Zero build is using Maven 3.6.x and has been tested with Oracle JDK8 and OpenJDK 11.

From version 1.4 on Java 8 is required at runtime. From version 1.11 on Java 11 is minimum requirement.

"mvn package" will build a WAR file "esb0.war"

### How to deploy ###

ESB Zero requires a Java Servlet Container conforming to the servlet 3.1 API, i.e. Java EE 7 and Java/Jakarta EE 8.
 
It has been tested with Tomcat 8, 8.5, 9, Wildfly, Jetty 9 and JBoss EAP 7.x.
For Tomcat 10.x (Jakarta EE 9) you must make use of the migration tool (by deploying the WAR to *webapps-javaee* instead of *webapps*) or use JakartaEE9 branch from git repository.

ESB Zero is built with Java 11 and has been tested with OpenJDK 11 and OpenJDK 17.

ESB Zero needs one directory to retrieve service flows and other artifacts from and persist to.
Per default it is expected to have a folder named "esb_root" in the user home folder (of the user running the servlet container).
Either create an empty directory with name "esb_root" there or set environment variable ESB_ROOT_DIR to an existing folder of your choice.
In a cluster setup it is also possible to use a DB(via JNDI DataSource) for storing/retrieving service artifacts if you cannot go for a cluster file system.

__Note__: This folder can be empty but it must exist!

If you are using JMS or JDBC actions within your flows you'll need to configure JMS-Providers and/or Datasources in your Servlet Container. These resources will be acquired by JNDI lookup.
For JDBC there is special support for Oracle DB built in (e.g. handling java.sql.Array), but any other DB works as well.
JMS-Providers being successfully used in productive environments are ActiveMQ, Oracle AQ, TIBCO EMS, IBM MQ.

Note: Some JMS Providers do not offer ootb JNDI Integration (e.g. Oracle AQ) or deliver a RAR which only enables heavy weight EJB MDBs.
To get them available via JNDI in your servlet container of choice you can use a simple ObjectFactoryAdapter provided here [aq-jndi](https://github.com/karalus/aq-jndi).

Deploy it in your servlet container of choice.

Test if the admin UI is accessible (For access use a user which has the role "esb0admin" assigned): http://localhost:8080/esb0/admin

### Working with the sources ###

Modern IDEs typically recognize maven projects and create a project based on the pom.xml:
1) Either you use a maven project import wizard
2) Or create something like a "Dynamic Web Project" as the result should be a WAR

### On which projects/technology does ESB Zero depend on? ###
There are only very few dependencies:

It is written in Java 11 and implements a servlet based on 3.1 API.

- For WSDL parsing [WSDL4J](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsdl4j/) is used.
- For XML processing we use the XQJ implementation in [Saxon-HE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/Saxon-HE/)
- The XML-Artifacts for service flows are instantiated via [JAXB](https://javaee.github.io/jaxb-v2/)
- FastInfoset support is implemented using [metro-fi](https://github.com/javaee/metro-fi).
- Logging is done with [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/). Optionally combined with [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) it gives the best performance.

Optional
- For using Kafka you need the [Kafka Java Client](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients)
- For using ActiveMQ as JMS provider you need to include it into your Servlet Container
- For using Oracle AQ or IBM MQ as JMS provider refer to [aq-jndi](https://github.com/karalus/aq-jndi)

### Roadmap ###

__1.12__ (Q1 2025):
- divide source into modules using parent POM

__Backlog:__
- migrate to Jakarta EE 9 (at least when Tomcat 9.0 and JBoss 7.4 reached EOL)
- make use of virtual threads (requires Java 21 minimum)
